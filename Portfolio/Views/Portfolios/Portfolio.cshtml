                    The Charleston Planner is a web application catering to locals and/or tourists interested in social events
                    around Charleston, SC. Anonymous users can see a list of local events through our API. Anonymous users can search through events by keyword. Users can
                    click on a title of an event to see a detailed view of event information. Authenticated
                    users register with name, email, and password, and they login with email and password.
                    Authenticated users can mark events they are interested in as well as see the list of events
                    they have already marked. They can add new events through a form to the database. This is a team project, I am the back-end engineer.
